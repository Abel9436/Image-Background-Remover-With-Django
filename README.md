# Image Background Remover with Django

This Django-based web application allows users to upload images and automatically remove their backgrounds using advanced machine learning techniques. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for seamlessly removing backgrounds from images, making it easier to create transparent images or composites with custom backgrounds.

## Features

- **Intuitive Web Interface**: A modern and responsive web interface built with Django, allowing users to easily upload images and initiate the background removal process.
- **Background Removal Algorithm**: Leveraging the powerful `rembg` library, this application utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and remove backgrounds from a wide variety of images.
- **Preview and Download**: Users can preview the processed image with the background removed and download the resulting transparent image file.
- **File Management**: Uploaded images are securely stored and managed within the Django project's file system.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Built on the robust Django web framework, this application is designed to be scalable and easily extensible with additional features or integrations.
